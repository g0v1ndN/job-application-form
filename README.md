## About:
Welcome to my basic job application form, which I created using HTML and CSS to gain a better understanding of these languages. As a beginner in web development, I am eager to learn and improve my skills. Through building this form, I have delved into the basics of HTML and CSS and learned how they can be used to create a simple yet functional job application form.

## Features:
Here are a few features of this webpage.
1. The webpage is an HTML form used for job applications for web development.
2. The form is divided into two sections, the top section with the title and introductory paragraph and the container section with the form.
3. The webpage is styled with CSS, including background color, font size, margin, padding, border radius, box shadow, and more.
4. The form contains various input fields for the candidate's name, email, phone number, country, city, address, desired position, additional information, and a file upload field for the candidate's CV.
5. The form has labels for each input field to provide clear instructions to the candidate.
6. The form has CSS classes that control the layout and styling of the input fields, labels, and buttons.
7. The form uses a grid layout for the input fields, allowing for a responsive design that adapts to the size of the screen.
8. The form has some input fields with specific input types, such as email and number fields.
